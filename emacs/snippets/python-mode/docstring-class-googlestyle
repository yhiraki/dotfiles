\"\"\"${The summary line for a class docstring should fit on one line.}

${If the class has public attributes, they may be documented here
in an \`\`Attributes\`\` section and follow the same formatting as a
function's \`\`Args\`\` section. Alternatively, attributes may be documented
inline with the attribute's declaration (see __init__ method below).

Properties created with the \`\`@property\`\` decorator should be documented
in the property's getter method.}

Attributes:
    ${attr1 (str): Description of \`attr1\`.
    attr2 (:obj:\`int\`, optional): Description of \`attr2\`.}
